		<h2>Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)</h2>
		<p><h3>Pathogenesis:</h3>
Firstly, the E.coli enters into the intestine of host through ingestion of contaminated food. Then, the bacteria releases toxin called Shiga toxin which damages the intestinal lining. After damaging the intestinal lining, it gets into contact of circulation which subsequently causes septicemia and toxemia. Afterward, attachment to glomeruli of kidney occurs and damages the glomerular endothelium. This subsequently causes platelet activation and aggregation. This causes platelet plug which ultimately block the blood vessel and cause microangiopathy. Due to immense pressure on narrow passage, there occurs red blood cell lysis which causes “Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia”<br>
Thus, Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) occurs.<br>

<h3>Clinical Findings:</h3>
There will be presence of schistocyte/ hemlet cell which is basically the abnormal shaped RBC on blood smear due to lysis. We will also find thrombocytopenia, increased reticulocyte, increased free hemoglobin, decreased RBC, decreased hemoglobin, decreased haptoglobin, hematuria, renal failure etc.<br>

Here is a youtube link of a video I made for making this easier. Pause or play in slow motion as the video might be too fast.</p><br>
